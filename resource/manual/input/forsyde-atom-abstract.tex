This chapter is an extended API documentation of \textsc{ForSyDe-Atom} Standard Library version \AtomVersion\footnote{available at: \url{https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-atom}} which was organized to also serve the purpose of technical report. It treats both theoretical and practical aspects, justifying the implementation and providing examples of usage for most of the library-exported functions. It has been generated from the inline documentation using a \href{https://www.haskell.org/haddock/}{\mbox{Haddock}}\footnote{custom build from: \url{https://github.com/ugeorge/haddock}} generator.
